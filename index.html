<h2>
research engineer in cognitive science
</h2>

<p>2019-present</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Leading the development of quantifiable benchmarks in the detection of critical phase transitions in neural data: in cooperation with the Feinstein Institute of New York and the Hacettepe Medical Center of Ankara. Our goal is to build an ML pipeline which might detect criticality and phase transition in any given biological dataset. Papers forthcoming.</p></li>

<li><p>Engineering consultant for the design and implementation of reliable backends suitable to multimodal neuromorphic models: the combination of dMRI tractography, fMRI timeseries, electrocorticography, and others requires both imagination and engineering discipline. <a href="https://cerebromap.me/">Like this</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Thought leadership at the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and cognitive psychology. <a href="https://theodorewheeler.com/sample_situatedAI.pdf">Like this</a>.</p></li>

<h2>
software engineer, Google
</h2>

<p>
NYC and Munich, 2012-2017
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Technical lead for Google’s own documentation engine, responsible for solving expertise dispersion in one of the fastest-growing codebases in the world.
</li>

<li>
Because of my background in psychology, I excelled in generating solutions for "imposter syndrome": keeping engineers happy, empowered, and eager to share their expertise. We ended up building a new framework for knowledgebase queries and documentation integrations with the full stack.
</li>

<li>
Leadership in code health and developer education: our platform was part of the "docs as code" movement which, along with the rise of Markdown, helped change how engineers think about documentation globally. I wrote the documentation style guide for all of Google engineering, solving many longstanding points of frustration and inefficiency. We backed it up with a linter, a formatter, and many exciting features to make docs enjoyable to the engineer.
</li>
